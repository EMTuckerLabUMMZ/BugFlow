# Module 1C: Proactive Data Capture in Field

## Module Purpose: 
This module outlines what data should be captured and recorded while collecting specimens in the field in order to efficiently create specimen locality labels and seamlessly integrate data with other resources, most likely databases.

## Module Keywords: 
pre-digitization, field work, metadata, transcription, label generation


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1| Task name here.|Definition, comments, description. Should be general and not reference particular software or taxa.| Links to resources  Links to workflows  Links to controlled vocabularies|
|T2|Record data into field notes|**Localiy data:** Country, State/Province/Department, County/Municipality, specific locality, GPS coordinates. **Date**. Habitat/microhabitat or substrate notes. **Collecting method**. **Collector(s)**. Assign **field number**. **Optional:** notes on weather and time of collecting; notes on live appearance of specimens; rough list of taxa in the sample; rough estimate of specimens; add image numbers for habitat in case photographs are taken. Ideally add provisionary label with FULL data to sample. At the very minimum, add a label with field number to sample| Have template at hand for headings of data to record.|
