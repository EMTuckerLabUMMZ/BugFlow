# Module 3D: Label Imaging

## Module Purpose: 
This module is for imaging labels attached to specimens that can be detached from the specimen (e.g. wet, pinned, envelope, but not slide labels)

## Module Keywords: 
imaging, metadata, label data, low-resolution


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1|Select and transport containers (drawers/vial racks/slide boxes) to proximity of imaging station.|The workflow outlined for this module is designed for label imaging only.  However, some institutions merge label imaging with collecting event record creation by creating an accompanying skeleton collecting event/locality record immediately following T8. Such records are created in a database or spreadsheet at the time of imaging and fully populated immediately or in M4C. This facilitates bulk processing of images and associated database records, especially when using software systems such as Specify, Symbiota, or EMu that provide for importing spreadsheet data. In such cases, barcode values, determination data, collecting event data, and collecting event identifiers are pre-populated into the spreadsheet. As data from the spreadsheet are later imported into the database, specimen records can be associated with pre-existing (or newly created) collecting event records.|Institutional imaging policy.

|T2|Set aside containers with damaged specimens for conservation workflow.|Re-route specimen to conservation workflow per conservation policy, Whether to image labels before conservation depends upon the severity of the damage.|Institutional conservation policy.|
|T3|Select and remove to work area (selected) specimen(s) from container.|Selected specimens are those for which label-imaging is intended.  Exemplar specimens may also be selected at this step, if subsequent exemplar imaging is intended.|Institutional digitization policy.|
|T4|Un-pin and remove label(s), flattening (closing) pinholes from back side, if necessary for legibility.|Maintain sequence of labels.|Forceps for removing labels. See [SPNHC newsletter 26(2):18](http://www.spnhc.org/media/assets/September2012final.pdf)|
|T5|Identify unique collecting event label(s), primary data label(s), and labels for collectors, host plants, or other habitat/ecological data from representative specimens.||Institutional imaging policy.|
|T6|Associate the specimen catalog number and/or barcode value with the collecting event labels, if not otherwise completed.|If specimens do not have the catalog number associated during an individual specimen handling process, it happens here.  This may require creating a database record or row in a spreadsheet or database, as referenced in T1 comments and explanations.|This task is usually easier for brand new, unpopulated databases.|
|T7|Arrange removed label(s) (and any additional new label(s) added during digitization activities) and collecting event label(s) on stage or other apparatus.|Additional labels will include barcode or other unique identifier label and others, depending on imaging purpose, e.g. project designation, date image taken, etc.|Specimen or label stage or holding apparatus.|
|T8|Record image of label(s).|Adjustments may be required for specimens with text on both upper and lower surfaces of the label(s). This might entail transcribing text from lower surface to a temporary label to be included within the image then discarded.|For further information on imaging guidelines and standards, [see](https://www.idigbio.org/content/idigbio-image-file-format-requirements-and-recommendations)|
|T9|Save/name image file in a standard, institutionally determined format.|A file-naming scheme that mirrors the collecting event identifier is sometimes used. Examples might include: <country code>+<state code>+<verbatim directions>+<collector name>+<date>+<serial identifier>, or a subset of these.|Institutional file-naming protocol.|
|T10|Re-pin labels in original sequence, adding any additional labels created as part of the imaging process, including a unique identifier label as necessary.|The insertion of unique identifier labels might also occur during Pre-digitization curation (M1).|Institutional imaging policy.|
|T11|Re-insert specimen into tray or drawer and tray into drawer.|||
|T12|Scan barcode value into database to create one or more provisional specimen records, or directly into image metadata, as appropriate.|Some institutions create provisional database records at this stage. However, this task might also be accomplished at data capture time, e.g. M4AT4.||
|T13|Return drawers to collection and flag beginning point for next imaging session.|Returning drawers to cabinets might occur in bulk at the end of an imaging session.||
