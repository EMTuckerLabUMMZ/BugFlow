# Module 4E: Slide photo-stacked hi-res imaging

## Module Purpose: 
This module shows how to create a high-resolution image of a slide-mounted specimen using focus-stacking or other high-resolution technology that creates a crisp, clear image of the specimen(s) mounted on that slide at a resolution high enough to see the majority of the deatures needed for identification. 

The workflow outlined for this module is designed for slide imaging in high resolution only. However, some institutions merge slide imaging with collecting event record creation by creating an accompanying skeleton collecting event/locality record immediately following T8. Such records are created in a database or spreadsheet at the time of imaging and fully populated immediately or in [M3B](https://github.com/EntCollNet/BugFlow/blob/master/modules/module_3/module_3B.md). This facilitates bulk processing of images and associated database records, especially when using software systems such as Specify, Symbiota, EMu, or TaxonWorks that provide for importing spreadsheet data. In such cases, barcode values, determination data, collecting event data, and collecting event identifiers are pre-populated into the spreadsheet. As data from the spreadsheet are later imported into the database, specimen records can be associated with pre-existing (or newly created) collecting event records.

| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1| Select and transport containers (slide boxes/slide racks/slide drawers) to proximity of imaging/scanning station.|| Institutional imaging policy|
|T2| Set aside slides with damaged labels/specimens for conservation workflow. |Re-route slide to conservation workflow per conservation policy. Whether to image specimens before conservation depends upon the severity of the damage.|Institutional conservation policy|
|T3| If specimens are not catalogued, transcribed, or databased, decide on whether to do so before or after imaging. Regardless, imaged specimens should be associated with a unique identifier such as a catalog number.|Exemplar high resolution imaging can be done before or after typical databasing of a slide specimen. Generally, digitization of specimens is a different workflow than imaging specimens in high resolution, and should be thought about separately, although associating images with specimens is much easier if they already at least have an database record created with an associated unique identifier.||
|T4| Select and remove exemplar specimens for high resolution imaging to work area from container.|Slides to be imaged may come from [Module 4FT3](https://github.com/EntCollNet/BugFlow/blob/master/modules/module_4/module_4F.md)| Institutional digitization policy|
|T5| Arrange specimen(s)s on photographic jig.| Lighting, positioning, and magnification of specimens is all dependent on the specimen on slide. Check if filters, such as polarization or phase contrast, are necessary to view diagnostic features.|Specimen or label stage or holding apparatus.|
|T5aaa| I need more detail here but have never done this ||
|T6|Conduct photographic stacking of specimens embedded in medium. ||Imaging guide|
|T8|Save/name image file in a standard, institutionally determined format.|A file-naming scheme that mirrors the collecting event identifier is sometimes used. Examples might include: "country code"+"state code"+"verbatim directions"+"collector name"+"date"+"serial identifier", or a subset of these. This can also be done using batch renaming using programs like Adobe Bridge, IrfanView (free), or Inselect (free). Inselect can also parse out multiple slides in one image, read QR codes, and rename files based on the embedded information.|Free software: [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/), [Inselect](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/inselect/). Institutional file-naming protocol|
|T9|Re-insert specimen slide into container and container into larger container (e.g. slide into slide box).|Repeat Steps T3-T11 until container(s) already removed from collection are finished.||
|T10|Add unique identifier into database to create one or more provisional specimen records, or directly into image metadata, as appropriate. Or, add images directly and create stub records from images that can later be transcribed in house or via crowdsourcing.|Some institutions create provisional database records at this stage. However, this task might also be accomplished at data capture time.||
|T11|Return containers to collection and flag beginning point for next imaging session.|Returning slide boxes or trays to cabinets might occur in bulk at the end of an imaging session. It is recommended that all completed slide boxes, drawers, cabinets, etc. get a label, sticker, or other marking that indicates all specimen labels in that unit or container were imaged. This will save a great deal of time when trying to find specimens in the collection already imaged or ones that are still in need of imaging.||
