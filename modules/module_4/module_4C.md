# Module 4C: Enveloped or "flat" Imaging

## Module Purpose: 
This module is for imaging flat-preserved specimens using flat photography or scanning methods that create a high-resolution, in-focus image of the entire specimen and labels, including enveloped or papered Lepidoptera or Odonata.

## Module Keywords: 
Imaging, 2D, photography, flat, butterfly, dragonfly, envelope, papered


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1|Select specimens to digitize|Pick specimens to be digitized depending on project or priority, sending specimens needing conservation to conservation workflow.||
|T2|Move specimens or container of specimens to imaging/preparation workstation.|||
|T3|Select digitization method, either scanning or photography|Make sure to test for lighting, as transparent (cellophane) envelopes can create undesired light strokes in the images. If these are unavoidable, just make sure that they are not obscuring the specimen or label data. Decide on an image storage solution (in specimen level database, separate, etc ...)||
|T4|Prepare specimens and labels.|Add unique identifiers (if needed), and that all label information is also being photographed.||
|T5|Image capture.|Make sure that the resolution of your scan or photograph allows you to see details of the specimen and that labels are readable. Include a scale bar and color calibration marker in the area imaged.||
|T6|File naming|Rather than using the default machine-generated image numbers, define a standard for naming images, ideally including the catalog number or unique identifier of the specimen. Skip if your image storage solution handles this for you (see T3)||
|T7|Mark imaged specimens|Add a label indicating that the specimen has been imaged||
|T8|Move imaged specimens back into collection.|||
