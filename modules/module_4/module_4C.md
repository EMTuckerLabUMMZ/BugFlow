# Module 4C: Enveloped or "flat" Imaging

## Module Purpose: 
This module is for imaging flat-preserved specimens using flat photography or scanning methods that create a high-resolution, in-focus image of the entire specimen and labels, including enveloped or papered Lepidoptera or Odonata.

## Module Keywords: 
Imaging, 2D, photography, flat, butterfly, dragonfly, envelope, papered

|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T0| Task name here.|Definition, comments, description. Should be general and not reference particular software or taxa.| Links to resources  Links to workflows  Links to controlled vocabularies|
|T1|Select specimens to digitize|Pick specimens to be digitized depnding on project or priority||
|T2|Select digitization method|Specimens in envelopes can be digitized using a scanner or by photographing. Define image storage solution. Make sure to test for lighting, as transparent (cellophane) envelopes can create undesired light strokes in the images. If these are unavoidable, just make sure that they are not obscuring the specimen or label data||
|T3|Prepare specimens|Make sure specimens have unique identifiers associated with them, and that the specimen is not covering label information||
|T4|Scanning or photographing|Make sure that the resolution of your scan or photograph allows to see details of the specimen and that labels are readable. Include a scale bar in the area to image||
|T5|File naming|Rather than using the default machine-generated image numbers, define a standard for naming images, ideally including the catalog number or unique identifier of the specimen||
|T6|Mark imaged specimens|Add a label indicating that the specimen has been imaged||
