# Module 4F: Slide Label/low-res Imaging

## Module Purpose: 
Use this module to image slide labels (and usually the associated slide-mounted specimen) at high enough resolution that the labels can be transcribed and read without difficulty, and the number of specimens can be counted. 

## Module Keywords: 
slide, imaging, low-resolution, labels


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1| Select and transport containers (slide boxes/slide racks/slide drawers) to proximity of imaging/scanning station.|The workflow outlined for this module is designed for label imaging only. However, some institutions merge label imaging with collecting event record creation by creating an accompanying skeleton collecting event/locality record immediately following T8. Such records are created in a database or spreadsheet at the time of imaging and fully populated immediately or in M4C. This facilitates bulk processing of images and associated database records, especially when using software systems such as Specify, Symbiota, EMu, or TaxonWorks that provide for importing spreadsheet data. In such cases, barcode values, determination data, collecting event data, and collecting event identifiers are pre-populated into the spreadsheet. As data from the spreadsheet are later imported into the database, specimen records can be associated with pre-existing (or newly created) collecting event records.| Institutional imaging policy|
|T2| Set aside slides with damaged labels/specimens for conservation workflow. |Re-route slide to conservation workflow per conservation policy. Whether to image labels before conservation depends upon the severity of the damage.|Institutional conservation policy|
|T3|Select and remove to work area (selected) specimen slide(s) from container.| Selected specimen slides are those for which label-imaging is intended. Exemplar specimens may also be selected at this step, if subsequent exemplar imaging is intended.| Institutional digitization policy|
|T4| Position slide(s) on imaging station/scanner bed. Maintain the sequence of slides as in box/tray/container.|Best practice is to use a template of some kind so that slide(s) are placed in the same position and order every time. Examples include, but are not limited to: guide tape on the workbench marking slide positions, a clear projector film with numbered spaces, or a clear three dimensional rig that can be placed on a scanner bed to hold slide(s). Remember, slides and labels are often old and fragile and should be handled with care.| add TCN TPT example & doc...|
|T5|Identify unique collecting event label(s), primary data label(s), and labels for collectors, host plants, or other habitat/ecological data from representative specimens.|Generally, slide labels can all be broken down into three classes:
Collecting event label(s)
Determination label(s)
Unique Identifier label (aka Catalog Numbers)
Collecting event labels are usually located on one side of the slide, while determination labels are usually on the opposite side of the slide. Determination labels may contain both specimen and host taxonomic information, or host information may be included on the collecting event label depending on the collector. Unique identifier labels may or may not be an additional smaller label.|Institutional imaging policy|
|T6|Associate the specimen catalog number and/or barcode value with the collecting event labels, if not otherwise completed.|If specimens do not have the catalog number associated during an individual specimen handling process, it happens here. This may require creating a database record or row in a spreadsheet or database, as referenced in T1 comments and explanations. This task is usually easier for brand new, unpopulated databases.||
|T7|Arrange slide(s) (with any additional new label(s) added during digitization activities) on stage or other apparatus.|Additional labels will include barcode or other unique identifier label and others, depending on imaging purpose, e.g. project designation, date image taken, etc.|Specimen or label stage or holding apparatus.|
|T8|Record image of label(s) alongside specimen.|Adjustments may be required for specimens with text on both upper and lower surfaces of the slide(s). This might entail transcribing text from lower surface to a temporary label to be included within the image then discarded, or taking one image of the slide labels from one side and another with the double-sided slide flipped over.|For further information on imaging guidelines and standards, see [iDigBio Image File Format Guide](https://www.idigbio.org/content/idigbio-image-file-format-requirements-and-recommendations)|
|T9|Save/name image file in a standard, institutionally determined format.|A file-naming scheme that mirrors the collecting event identifier is sometimes used. Examples might include: "country code"+"state code"+"verbatim directions"+"collector name"+"date"+"serial identifier", or a subset of these. This can also be done using batch renaming using programs like Adobe Bridge, IrfanView (free), or Inselect (free). Inselect can also parse out multiple slides in one image, read QR codes, and rename files based on the embedded information.|Free software: [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/), [Inselect](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/inselect/). Institutional file-naming protocol|
|T10|Re-insert specimen slide into container and container into larger container (e.g. slide into slide box).|Repeat Steps T3-T11 until container(s) already removed from collection are finished.||
|T11|Add unique identifier into database to create one or more provisional specimen records, or directly into image metadata, as appropriate. Or, add images directly and create stub records from images that can later be transcribed in house or via crowdsourcing.|Some institutions create provisional database records at this stage. However, this task might also be accomplished at data capture time.||
|T12|Return containers to collection and flag beginning point for next imaging session.|Returning slide boes or trays to cabinets might occur in bulk at the end of an imaging session. It is recommended that all completed slide boxes, drawers, cabinets, etc. get a label, sticker, or other marking that indicates all specimen labels in that unit or container were imaged. This will save a great deal of time when trying to find specimens in the collection already imaged or ones that are still in need of imaging.||
