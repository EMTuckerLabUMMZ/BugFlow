# Module 4I: Wet Soup Low-res Imaging 

## Module Purpose: 
What is this module for? What data will be gathered? 
This module will look at imaging workflow for bulk entomology samples (referred to as 'wet insect soups').
Wet insect soups are bulk samples of insects collected at a single location over a period time. Collecting methods vary but include pitfall, malaise, litter etc. Such soups are often collected as part of a study of a particular taxonomic group and/or the insect diversity and abundance of a geographic area. Some are sorted to order, others have some specimens removed, some are totally unsorted.

## Module Keywords: 
Five or six keywords that make searching easier
Wet insect soup, bulk samples, malaise traps, pan traps, yellow pan, pitfall

## Module Metrics, Costing, and Reporting: 
Define metrics that can be measured to assess success of workflows using this module (reference specific TaskIDs).

## Outreach Opportunities: 
List outreach opportunities that arise in workflows using this module (reference specific TaskIDs).
Soups represent a largely untapped resource for ecological and taxanomic studies because they are generally only accessed by taxonomic specialists who visit an institution. By imaging the contents of these soups, and any future plans to make them available on the web with appropriate tools, will enable taxonomic researchers to access a searchable library of tagged insect images.
Online volunteers can identify ordinal diversity and abundance and clip out and tag images of individual specimens for inclusion in a tagged image based search engine for taxon discovery (see publication, Automated Image Analysis on Insect Soups https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2016.7797010). One such site for outreach opportunities using crowdsourcing is: https://insectsoup.australian.museum/
